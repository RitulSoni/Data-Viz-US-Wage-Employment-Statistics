# United States Employment and Wage Statistics - A Tableau Visualization

Welcome to the repository for our dynamic and intuitive Tableau Visualization project that presents comprehensive data on employment and wage statistics in the United States. This project employs powerful visualization tools like Bubble Graphs and Racing Bar Charts, along with various filtering options to provide an in-depth understanding of the evolution and trends in different occupations over the years. 

## Overview

The Tableau visualization tool in this project will help you explore a wide range of data parameters such as:
- Average mean salary 
- Average hourly salary 
- Number of people employed in different fields

This tool is instrumental in shedding light on jobs that have been automated over the past 20 years. It allows us to anticipate potential occupational risks and enhance our comprehension of the effects of the AI boom on the job market. For your convenience, all the data has been adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers.

## Features

- **Bubble Graphs:** Provide an easy and appealing way to visualize complex data. The size of the bubble represents the magnitude of data, allowing you to compare different occupations at a glance.

- **Racing Bar Charts:** Dynamic and engaging, these charts provide a historical timeline showing how different occupations have competed over the years in terms of wage and employment numbers.

- **Filter options:** User-friendly filters allow you to sift through data based on specific parameters, making it easier for you to find the information that's most relevant to you.
